longan_leaf_blight:
cause: fungal pathogens causing drying leaf lesions; favored by prolonged humidity; spreads via rain splash;
treatment: remove blighted leaves; apply fungicides; improve light penetration;
prevention: reduce shade; prune regularly; avoid overcrowded planting;

longan_root_rot:
cause: Phytophthora or other soil pathogens infecting roots; worsened by poor drainage; causes wilting and stunting;
treatment: improve drainage; remove severely infected trees; apply phosphonate if recommended;
prevention: plant in raised beds; avoid waterlogging; maintain good soil aeration;

sapodilla_leaf_spot:
cause: fungal infection producing circular brown spots; spreads through moisture and rainfall; common in tropical sapodilla orchards;
treatment: remove infected leaves; apply fungicides; improve airflow;
prevention: prune canopy; reduce overcrowding; remove leaf litter;

sapodilla_fruit_rot:
cause: fungi infecting fruit through skin cracks or insect wounds; spreads in humidity; causes soft watery rot;
treatment: remove infected fruit; improve ventilation; avoid fruit injury; apply fungicide if necessary;
prevention: sanitize orchard; harvest carefully; prune for good airflow;

sapodilla_blossom_end_rot:
cause: calcium transport issues combined with fungal opportunists; causes dark sunken fruit-end lesions; worsened by inconsistent watering;
treatment: maintain even irrigation; apply calcium foliar sprays if recommended; remove affected fruits;
prevention: ensure consistent soil moisture; avoid drought stress; maintain balanced nutrition;

soursop_pink_disease:
cause: pink fungal growth on branches; spreads through humid nights; infects bark and weakens branches;
treatment: prune infected branches; disinfect tools; apply sulfur or copper-based treatments;
prevention: improve airflow; reduce moisture accumulation; prune during dry weather;

tropical_root_rot_complex:
cause: mixed fungi and oomycetes attacking roots in saturated soil; common in tropical low-drainage orchards; leads to yellowing, stunting, dieback;
treatment: improve drainage; remove severely infected trees; apply phosphonate or appropriate fungicides;
prevention: plant on mounds; avoid waterlogging; maintain good soil structure; prune to reduce canopy stress;
